# Week 4 – Log (Feb 9-15)

## What I learned this week
This week I learned how CSS controls the presentation layer of a website and how it separates structure (HTML) from styling (CSS). 
I better understand the box model (content, padding, border, margin) and how spacing affects layout. 
 I also learned how to use selectors (element, class, id) and how CSS specificity determines which styles are applied. 
 Another key concept was layout using Flexbox, especially how to control alignment, spacing, and positioning of elements on a page. 
Overall, I focused on understanding how styling decisions affect user experience and page structure rather than just memorizing syntax.

## Challenges I faced
The most challenging part was understanding why certain styles were not being applied. 
Specificity and cascading rules were confusing at first. 
I worked through this by reviewing the slides, testing small changes in my code, and using browser developer tools to see which styles were overriding others

## AI usage (if any)
I used AI to clarify concepts like specificity and the box model. 
I asked for simple explanations and examples, then modified the examples to fit my own project. 
I made sure to test and adjust the code rather than copying it directly.

## Questions going forward
I still want to better understand responsive design and how media queries work in more complex layouts. 
I also want to explore best practices for organizing CSS in larger projects.

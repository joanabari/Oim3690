## What I learned this week
-I advanced a lot in my fitness app. I was able to find a customer and define how I want it to look like
-How display: flex works and how to use justify-content and align-items
-The difference between Flexbox (one direction) and Grid (rows + columns)
-How to use gap for spacing
-How repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)) makes layouts responsive

## Challenges I faced
-Playing the CSS game was pretty challenging but I did good in the end!! ![alt text](../images/cssdiner.png)

# Week 5 – Log (Feb 16-22)

## What I learned this week
I made a session 9 demo including more colours and other attributes. 

## Challenges I faced
The most challenging part was that I was not in class so I had to go through the slides and figure out what as done in class.

## Questions going forward
I want to understand better how to crete the new projects and start looking at new ideas.
